    <div class="three"><p>Overview</p><p>Thank you for looking me up! I have a wide array of passions and interests, and I hope this portfolio will help you learn more about me as an employee and collaborator on projects.I have a background in legal research and enjoy projects that unite my passions for history and law. I have worked on a number of exhibits using archival and historical collections including an online archive of material from Michigan suffragette Lucia Grimes and continuity stills from Orson Welles Citizen Kane. I would love to contribute to other digitization and archival projects in the future. I have worked in a number of offices and venues where I have built skills in leadership, project development, managment, presentation, legal work and much more. In the future I hope to combine my love of law and history pursing a crareer as a general counsel memeber in a museum.</p></div>
